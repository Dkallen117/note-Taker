# note-Taker ![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Dkallen117/readMe-Generator)

## Description 

This application utilizes the Express npm package to save, store, and delete notes. Applying Express to this application was a great way to gain experience on how the front-end connects to a back-end database. From the live Heroku link (another great learning experience), the user is taken to a main page, where they click a button to be taken to the note-taking page. From there, the user can then write, save, and delete notes, via the write (pencil), save (floppy disk), and delete (trash can) icons. See the GIF below for a demo!
